# ### Lock animated

# This is a simulation of a ship lock, similar to the ones we can see in the Panama Canal or in some North European ports.
# The lock has two doors (left and right) which can open when the level of water is the same at both sides of the door.
# The picture below shows a particular moment of the simulation where we can observe the different components of the system.
# Ships are queueing at both sides of the lock: those coming from the left side(lship.number) are presented in blue colour while those coming from the right side(rship.number) are presented in red colour. In the picture below, lship.6 and lship.7 are queueing on the left, while rship.12, rship.13 and rship.14 are waiting on the right side. Both doors of the lock are closed because the water level inside the lock is switching from low level to high level, carrying two ships.

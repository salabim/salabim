Fully object oriented simulation, similar to must and Tomas.

Includes process control features, resources, queues, monitors. statistical distributions.

Powerful and high quality animation facilities, which can be virtually separated from the model code.

SimPy3, the most used DES under Python, does not follow the same process description method and is more difficult
to use for modellers. Also, salabim provides animation, queues, 'states', monitors for data
collection and presentation, tracing and statistical distributions, none of which are present in SimPy3.

See www.salabim.org for details. 

See www.salabim.org/manual for the documentation.

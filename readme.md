Salabim is a Python library for object-oriented discrete event simulation (DES) and animation.

## Introduction

Discrete event simulation (DES) finds applications in various logistical domains including production facilities, warehousing, airports, hospitals, mining, materials handling, steel mills, and computer network analysis.

Salabim follows a well-proven and intuitive process description method similar to Tomas and Must.</br>The package provides:

- Components
- Queues
- Resources
- Stores
- States
- Monitors for data collection and presentation
- 2D and 3D animation (including video production)
- Tracing facilities
- Advanced statistical sampling

In contrast to some other Python DES packages, salabim does not require the use of yield statements for process control, making it more straightforward to use. Salabim has minimal requirements, especially when animation is disabled.

## Features and documentation

- Cross-platform support: salabim runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS/iPadOS (Pythonista), and can even be used with "Python In Excel".

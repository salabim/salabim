Machine shop example

Covers:

- Interrupts
- Resources: PreemptiveResource

Scenario:
  A workshop has *n* identical machines. A stream of jobs (enough to
  keep the machines busy) arrives. Each machine breaks down
  periodically. Repairs are carried out by one repairman. The repairman
  has other, less important tasks to perform, too. Broken machines
  preempt theses tasks. The repairman continues them when he is done
  with the machine repair. The workshop works continuously.

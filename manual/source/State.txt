State
-----
States together with the Component.wait() method provide a powerful way of process interaction. 

A state will have a certain value at a given time. In its simplest form a component can then wait for
a specific value of a state. Once that value is reached, the compoent will be resumed.

Definition is simple, like ``dooropen=sim.State('dooropen')``. The default initial value is False, meaning
the door is closed.

Now we can say ::

    dooropen.set()

to open the door.

If we want a person to wait for an open door, we could say ::

    yield self.wait(dooropen)
    
If we just want at most one person to enter, we say ``dooropen.trigger(max=1)``.

We can obtain the current value by just calling the state, like in ::

    print('door is ',('open' if dooropen() else 'closed'))

Alternatively, we can get the current value with the get method ::

  print('door is ',('open' if dooropen.get() else 'closed'))

The value of a state is automatically monitored in the state.value timestamped monitor.

All components waiting for a state are in a salabim queue, called waiters().

States can be used also for non values other than bool type. E.g. ::

    light=sim.State('light', value='red')
    ...
    light.state.set('green')

Or define a int/float state ::

    level=sim.State('level', value=0)
    ...
    level.set(level()+10)

States have a number if monitors and timestamped monitors:

* value, where all the values ae collected over time
* waiters().length
* waiters().length_of_stay

Process interaction with wait()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A component can wait for a state to get a certain value. In its most simple form ::

    yield self.wait(dooropen)
    
Once the dooropen state is True, the component will continue.

As with request() it is possible to set a timeout with fail_at or fail_delay ::

    yield self.wait(dooropen, fail_delay=10)
    if self.failed:
        print('impatient ...')
        
In the above example we tested for a state to be True. 

There are three ways to test for a value:

Scalar testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to test for a certain value ::

    yield self.wait((light, 'green'))
    
Or more states at once ::
    
    yield self.wait((light, 'green'), night)  # honored as soon as light is green OR it's night
    yield self.wait((light, 'green'), (light, 'yellow'))  # honored as soon is light is green OR yellow
    
It is also possible to wait for all conditions to be satisfied, by adding ``all=True``::

    yield self.wait((light,'green'), enginerunning, all=True)  # honored as soon as light is green AND engine is running
    
Evaluation testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we use a string containing an expression that can evaluate to True or False. This is
done by specifying at least one ``$`` in the test-string. This ``$`` will be replaced at run time by
``state.value()``, where state is the state under test. Here are some examples ::

    yield self.wait((light, '$ in ("green","yellow")')) 
        # if at run time light.value() is 'green', test for eval(state.value() in ("green,"yellow")) ==> True
    yield self.wait((level, '$ < 30'))
        # if at run time level.value() is 50, test for eval(state.value() < 30) ==> False
        
During the evaluation, ``self`` refers to the component under test and ``state`` to the state under test.
E.g. ::

    self.limit = 30
    yield self.wait((level, 'self.limit >= $'))
        # if at run time level.value() is 10, test for eval(self.limit >= state.get()) ==> True, so honored
        
Function testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a more complicated but also more versatile way of specifying the honor-condition.
In that case, a function is required to specify the condition. The function needs to accept three
arguments:

* x = state.get()
* component component under test
* state under test

E.g.::
        
    yield self.wait((light, lambda x, _, _: x in ('green', 'yellow'))
        # x is light.get()
    yield self.wait((level, lambda x, _, _: x >= 30))
        # x is level.get()
        
And, of course, it is possible to define a function ::

    def levelreached(x):
        value, component, _ = x
        return value < component.limit
        
    ...
    
    self.limit = 30
    yield self.wait((level, levelreached))
    
Combination of testing methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to mix scalar, evaluation and function testing. And it's also possible to specify all=True
in any case.

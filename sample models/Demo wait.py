# demo wait.py
"""
Here, princes, are generated.
In the meantime, kings die.
The youngest prince, will become king.

If a new prince arrives, he checks, whether there's a king.
If so, he will wait for a kingdied trigger.
If not, he will become king.

Note that in this demo, the priority (-now) in wait is used to make
the youngest prince to become king.

This is demo of the trigger/waitfor mechanism,
just to allow one waiter to be honored.
